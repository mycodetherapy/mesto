# Project: Mesto

## If you want to visit the site, just [just click on the link.](https://mycodetherapy.github.io/mesto/index.html)

The Mesto service is a frontend of a website that allows you to add photos with descriptions, put likes and edit a user profile. This service can be used as a ready-made element for building a social network.

### It works like this:

- Adaptive layout is applied. HTML and CSS use: Grid Layout, Flexbox, @media, BEM.
- Frontend site interactivity is controlled by JavaScript ES6 code.
- The client-side code is built within the framework of the OOP paradigm and is divided into independent modules that contain classes.
- Classes get references to objects through the this context.
- Asynchrony in the control file is based on Callback functions.
- Data is collected through forms.
- Fetch requests are used to interact with the server: "GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE".
- The Webpack collector collects code from modules into a single file.

### If you want to work with the project locally:

1. Clone the repository from the main branch to your device. To do this, ente `git clone <repository address>` in the terminal.
2. Install dependencies - go to the repository folder in the terminal and type `npm install`
3. Run the project on the local server - enter `npm run dev` in the terminal

To date, the client side of the site uses object-oriented code, which may look confusing to an outsider developer. Therefore, my plans include refactoring to build a tree of elements using library tools React.js . At the same time, I want to apply a functional approach inside the reaction components. These measures should significantly simplify the support and development of the project in the future.
